# MarketWhisper: AI Financial Storyteller

## Problem
Retail investors often have difficulty understanding the underlying reasons behind stock price changes, insider trading activity, and shifts in social media sentiment. Most financial tools present raw data and charts but donâ€™t connect the dots between market events, sentiment, and analyst perspectives. MarketWhisper addresses this challenge by generating concise, readable narratives that explain market behavior and highlight potential risks.

## Objectives
- Aggregate stock price data, financial news, analyst recommendations, and social sentiment.
- Generate clear, human-readable narratives using large language models with prompt engineering.
- Provide an intuitive, interactive interface for exploring market insights.
- Demonstrate prompt engineering with persona setup and example-driven narrative generation.
- Deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) integrating data, AI-driven analysis, and a user-friendly experience.

## Features
- Stock data retrieval (historical prices, analyst info) using yfinance
- Mock sentiment scoring for prototyping (designed for future integration of live sentiment analysis)
- Narrative generation powered by OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, using prompt engineering techniques
- Chat interface for general financial questions
- Streamlit-based user interface for stock selection, time period, analysis, and metrics
- Display of key metrics: price change, sentiment, market cap, dividend yield, P/E ratio
- Extensible architecture for real-time data and advanced chat capabilities
