# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Problem

We use a public dataset of patient health data (age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more) to predict heart disease. The main goal is to catch as many true cases of heart disease as possible, so recall for the positive class is our top metric.

> **Dataset Source:**  
> Data comes from the UCI Heart Disease dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farzadnekouei/heart-disease-prediction) and [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). It includes 303 rows and 14 columns on patient metrics and test results.  
> *Note: The dataset is old (from 1998), has some quirks, and is mainly used for teaching and practice, and should not be used for real medical or legal decision-making.*

## Objectives

- Explore and summarize the data.
- Prepare the data by handling missing values, outliers, encoding, and scaling as needed.
- Build and tune machine learning models (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- Focus on recall for class 1 (heart disease present).
- Compare models using precision, recall, F1-score.

## Steps Overview

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Use Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for data and modeling.

2. **Load Data**  
   Read the CSV, check shape and types. No missing values.

3. **EDA & Preprocessing**  
   - Look at distributions and relationships (briefly).
   - Treat outliers (cap or transform).
   - **One-hot encode** nominal categorical variables; leave ordinal/binary as integers.
   - Use scaling and Box-Cox transformation where needed.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Set up pipelines for models needing scaling.
   - Use cross-validation and grid search to tune hyperparameters.
   - Optimize for recall (catch as many positive cases as possible).

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Compare models (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
   - Use recall, precision, and F1-score.
   - Highlight that in this context, recall for heart disease is most important.

6. **Conclusion**  
   - SVM and Random Forest often achieve the highest recall for class 1.
   - Results are for practice/learning only, not for use in real diagnostics.

#####Target Variable: The target variable to predict is the presence of heart disease, represented by the target column (1: presence, 0: absence).
#####Features (Independent Variables): Based on the dataset:
age
sex
cp (chest pain type)
trestbps (resting blood pressure)
chol (serum cholestoral in mg/dl)
fbs (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)
restecg (resting electrocardiographic results)
thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)
exang (exercise induced angina)
oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
slope (the slope of the peak exercise ST segment)
ca (number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy)
thal (thalassemia)
